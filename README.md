Numerical algorithms for noninvasive cardiac electrophysiology.

The main purpose of the project is to provide some numerical tools to help in heart electrophysiology researches. Primary goal is to solve forward and inverse problem of electrocardiography in the statement which includes full bidomain equations system.

Environment
-----------

In general this tool should work on any platform with modern C++ and Python. But now algorithms are tested on following platform:

<dl>
  <dt>Platform:</dt>
    <dd>Windows 8.1 (win-64)</dd>
	<dd>Intel Core i7-4702MQ CPU 2.20 GHz (4 cores)</dd>
	<dd>16G memory</dd>
  <dt>Python:</dt>
    <dd>Anaconda Python distribution [http://continuum.io]</dd>
    <dd>version 2.7.6</dd>
  <dt>C++:</dt>
